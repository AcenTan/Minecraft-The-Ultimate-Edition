Java or Bedrock? why not both of their best features in a Modpack with its own direction, vanilla plus ULTIMATE EDITION with the features of both!

 

tl/dr a mod pack that adds almost all the features of bedrock without sacrificing the features of java or vanilla, and improved vanilla features and game mechanics with the rendering, network and world generation engine.

 

This Modpack adds a friends list, multiplayer beyond LAN so you can play with your friends across the world wide web, and has built in controller support, emotes, a map, waypoints, pinging, it has direct message to your friends, it refines core features of the game with its code and rendering engines with sodium, lithium, indium, and iris, it has built in texture packs to refresh the games look and also an in game texture pack and resource pack search engine so no more running to Modrinth or Curseforge mid game.

 

This Modpack also revamps world generation without adding to many modded blocks and revamps the sound engine for crisper audio, it adds forward and backward version compatibility so you can play on servers on any version of the game or with friends as far as the essential versions support it and also includes a voice chat and better in game chat features and discord presence.

 

This Modpack is a work in progress but it tries to eliminate most bugs that occur within the game, this pack also has the essential store for emotes and a character customization market with essential, but also has its own 3d model importer/editor so you can make your own player model/skin on the fly, why pick java or bedrock, pick ULTIMATE EDITION, play on servers with geyser and bedrock compatibility and play with your friends regardless the server or game version, host online world like bedrock, purchase skins and explore a new world with your friends.
